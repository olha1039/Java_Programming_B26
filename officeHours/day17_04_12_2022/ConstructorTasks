              requirements:
                  1. user should be able to deposit money into their account --> deposit(double amount);
                      1.1 if the amount is less than or equal to 0
                               "Depositing amount can not be zero or negative"
                  2. user should be able to withdraw money from their account --> withdraw(double amount);
                      2.1 if the withdrawing account is greater than available balance
                                "Insufficient balance "
                      2.2 if the balance is less than or equal to 0, user should not be able to withdraw money
