        How can we perform encapsulation?

        -Make instance variable Private
        -Create a public getter
        -Create a public setter

        Benefits

        - Protect our data from INVALID input values
        - Use conditions for setter method to verify our data same with requested format

        Ex. Strong password -> Lowercase / upperCase / Numbers etc

        - Customize getter method to return our data in certain format

        Ex:  Decoding password

        12345 ----> Encrypt ---> ABCDE ---> Decoding ----> 12345

        How to make one instance variable READ_ONLY?
        - Use only GETTER method for this variable
        How to make one instance variable WRITE_ONLY?
        - Use only SETTER method for this variable

        Do we need to use both (setter / const ) in the same class?

        - Yes, they have slightly difference

        CONSTR - It will run ONCE when object is created
        SETTER - To update the value of instance variable


        What is a boiler plate?
