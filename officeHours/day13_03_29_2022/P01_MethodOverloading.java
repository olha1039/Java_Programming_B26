        /*
         If a class has multiple methods with the same it is called as Overloading

         ADV:
            - reusability
            - flexible
            - easy to memorize

            Rules:
            - numbers of parameters ---- overloading
            add (int a, int b);
            add (int a);
            - sequence of the parameters ---- overloading
            add (float a, int b);
            -return type --- invalid case --- there is no overloading

            If method signature are same we can't say there is an overloading
            Method Signature ---> it includes method name + parameter(s)
