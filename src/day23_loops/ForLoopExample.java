        flow of for loop:
            1) the loop executes the initialization part to declare and assign variable

            initialization: int i = 1;
            initialization part runs once in the beginning

            2) boolean condition/ termination condition
            -> if the boolean is true the loop with execute the statements
            -> if the boolean is false: the loop will stop

            in our example: i <=10

            3) the statements in the code body are executed top to bottom

            in our ex: System.out.println(i);

            4) update happens

            in our ex: i++

            5) goes back to step 2 and repeats
